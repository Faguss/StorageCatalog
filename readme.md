# StorageCatalog

Script I've made for my job. It takes id numbers of items and outputs locations in the storage.

Rules for finding storage locations are generated from a string storage key that is parsed on init.

Optionally storage aisle may have a list of distances from each shelf to the access point so that items will be sorted by shortest travel time.
